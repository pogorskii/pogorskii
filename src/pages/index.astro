        <p>Welcome to my personal platform, where I'm not afraid to be so authentic that it hurts. I believe that web (and tech in general) should be mighty progressive, experimental, visionary, and fun.</p>
        <p>And so does my personal brand.</p>
        <p>So instead of being all "professional", I'll do my best to keep things exciting and unconventional.</p>

    <section class="prose max-w-xl mx-auto mb-8">
        <p>I miss times, when we did stuff like this unironically, and without it being "cringe":</p>
        <Image src={LaravelBanner} alt="Epic 'I love Laravel' oldschool banner" class="my-2"/>
        <p>You bet I've just done that epic signature from scratch to prove a point, because here, we go <span
                class="font-bold">hard</span>!
        </p>
        <p>So, in short, lets make web fun again. And I'll start with myself.</p>

            You're the chosen one
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because you're one of the first people to see my blog in the most bare form (how scandalous).
        </p>
        <p>And don't you go "Who cares", because I do!</p>
        <p>And here's what you can expect to see here (eventually) (soon-ish):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Concise, authentic posts in general</li>
            <li>Insights about me figuring out ambitious pet projects</li>
            <li>Breakdowns of stuff I find fascinating and/or valuable</li>
            <li>Occasional rants about video games, TV shows, and stuff</li>
            <li>Life updates (maybe?)</li>
            <li>I don't know, whatever I feel like at the time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyways, this is supposed to be just a short blurb-placeholder, but I didn't want to just generate some AI greeting, so here's that.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by, and see ya in a bit!</p>
        <p>P.S. Damn, Astro is fast to develop with!</p>
        <p>P.P.S. Which is unfortunate, because now I have no excuses to delay developing this site further :)</p>
