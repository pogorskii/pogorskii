Is this thing on? Nope, I'm not being corny (or do I?), rather, I'm excited to see this thing ("thing" being my personal
blog) finally go live. Sure, it will look pretty bare bones at first, but that's not the point. I've been a
professional (meaning, employed) dev for only a few months, but I already know the important thing: you have to ship
stuff. Not just buy domains, start yet another local project, and repeat.

So I'm already on the right way!

## Let's get to know each other

It's a bit weird to introduce myself to, err, someone, I hope? If you are reading this, we probably know each other to
some capacity already. If not - Hi, nice to meet you! I promise that this blog will have worthwhile content if you're
into web dev or video games.

I'll keep the introduction short and to the point.

## From gaming journalism to web development - a 10-year-long journey

So anyway, I'm Stanislav (Stas for short, definitely NOT Stan), a - *checks own birth year* - 27 y.o. guy that recently
got into web development after 6 months of excruciating studying every living moment that wasn't occupied by my
soon-to-be-ex 9/5 job and sleep. And, may I say, worth it already!

I absolutely love writing code, building stuff, and learning a multitude of things. Those are my defining traits for
now - possibly, for the rest of my life.

To sum up my personal journey up until now: I always loved gadgets, computers, all of that geeky stuff. I even studied
at a college to become a developer. But then I took a weird and long detour: I got into gaming journalism. Because I
also always loved video games.

But, well, that career wasn't meant to last for a lot of reasons, so I hastily got back to my roots and actually learned
to code.

That's why this blog will be focused both on video games and web dev - I love both.

## Why should you even bother reading this blog?

Because of my personality! I mean, I hope it would become a selling point, but I'm well aware that it's something I can
show over a long time, so I have other selling points in my mind.

Again, to be short:

- If I'm passionate about something, then I'm **really** passionate about it, and it shows everywhere, including my
  posts.
- I wrote for a living for 10 years straight, so I know my way with words. Granted, 98% of my texts are in another
  language, and I'm not a native English speaker. But I know how to structure my thoughts and be fairly engaging in the
  way I convey them.
- This blog will be interesting and to the point. No clickbait, no nonsense. Ideally, I want to use this platform to
  help build my personal brand, and I certainly don't want to look bad.
- I can keep you in the loop about the gaming industry better than most. Yeah, a bold statement, but it's true.
  Obviously, I lack resources to cover anything, but if you see a post about something here, then you can be sure that
  it's high-quality.

## Moving on

Again, right now this blog is barely functional, so expect it to change A LOT over the next few months. I'll add more
features, make things look nice, and will slowly start to post here somewhat often.

For now, you can expect my coverage about something related to the upcoming gaming summer presentation (starting from
June 7th) and, probably, a story about how I managed to get into IT in this economy.

And, obviously, something about my ambitious pet projects - this blog is the smallest among them.

So, errr, bookmark (note to self: make it easier for people to actually follow the blog) this site, follow me on
X/Twitter and see ya in a bit!
